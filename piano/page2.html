                    <h3>Why does it make a sound when you click a key?</h3>
                    <p class="page2p">First, the keyboard is created using a single image. I use an image map (as
                        described <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp"
                            target="_blank">here</a>) to divide the image into multiple interactive areas, each
                        corresponding to a different key. Event listeners are then attached to these areas so that when
                        a user clicks on a specific part of the keyboard, a function is triggered. In this function, I
                        access the relevant piano note MP3 file, which I have included in the HTML using &lt;source&gt;
                        tags with unique IDs. When a key is clicked, the function retrieves the appropriate audio source
                        by its ID and plays the corresponding sound.</p>

                    <h3>Image Mapping</h3>
                    <p class="page2p">Not long ago, I read an article about image mapping in HTML, which gave me the
                        idea to split an image into different interactive sections. However, the keys on a piano
                        keyboard are neither perfect circles nor rectangles, making conventional shapes unsuitable for
                        mapping. Fortunately, the poly option allows you to define custom areas using coordinates. To
                        find the precise coordinates for each key, I used a website called PhotoPea. Since the image on
                        my webpage was resized to fit the layout, I had to adjust the original coordinates accordingly.
                        To make this process easier, I wrote a simple Python script to scale the width and height,
                        allowing me to quickly calculate the correct coordinates for each key.</p>

                    <h3>For Loop</h3>
                    <p class="page2p">Initially, I wrote separate play note functions for each key, which resulted in a
                        lot of repetitive code. I wondered if I could streamline this process using a loop. With some
                        assistance from AI, I realized it was possible. First, I created a list containing all the keys
                        of my keyboard. Then, instead of multiple functions, I wrote a single function that takes a
                        'key' argument. When triggered, this function uses the argument to find the corresponding audio
                        source in the HTML, stores it in a variable, and plays the note. For the event listeners, I used
                        a forEach loop to iterate over each key in the list, adding the appropriate event listener to
                        each mapped area in one concise step. This approach made the code much cleaner and more
                        efficient.</p>
